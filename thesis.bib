@article{rul:2008:sc,
	Abstract = {With the rise of chip-multiprocessors, the problem of parallelizing general-purpose programs has once again been placed on the research agenda. In the 1980s and early 1990s, great successes were obtained to extract parallelism from the inner loops of scientific computations. General-purpose programs, however, stayed out-of-reach due to the complexity of their control flow and data dependences.More recently, thread-level speculation (TLS) has been tauted as the definitive solution for general-purpose programs. TLS again targets inner loops. The program complexity issue is handled by checking and resolving dependences at runtime using complex hardware support. However, results so far have been disappointing and limit studies predict very low potential speedups, in one study just 18%.In this paper we advocate a completely different approach. We show that significant amounts of coarse-grain parallelism exists in the outer program loops, even in general-purpose programs. This coarse-grain parallelism can be exploited efficiently on CMPs without additional hardware support.This paper presents a technique to extract coarse-grain parallelismfrom the outer program loops. Application of this technique to the MiBench and SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks shows that significant amounts of outer-loop parallelism exist. This leads to a speedup of 5.18 for bzip2 compression and 11.8 for an MPEG2 encoder on a Sun UltraSPARC T1 CMP. The parallelization effort was limited to 10 to 20 person-hours per benchmark while we had no prior knowledge of the programs.},

@article{ramaseshan:08:nc,
	Abstract = {Abstract. Recent work on transactional memory (TM) bears promise to exploit multicore capabilities. TM extensions for thread-level speculative parallelism (TLS) have predominantly focused on integer benchmarks with short critical sections and exploit limited on-chip buffering space to store shadow values needed to potentially abort transactions. In contrast, scientific codes generally provide coarse-grained parallel regions with potentially shared memory accesses, which do not fit into size-limited shadow buffers. Hence, such codes represent a mismatch for TM-TLS. This work contributes mechanisms to speculatively parallelize scientific codes with dense, non-scalar data references exploiting compilation techniques and runtime enhancements coupled with minor hardware enhancements to transparently support TLS. A method to efficiently detect access violations to shared memory in speculatively parallelized regions is developed, much alike TM, yet with data footprints of arbitrarily large size. The mechanism for violation detection is based on runtime software and optional hardware support to efficiently capture regular access traces. Experimental evaluations assess the speculation overhead in presence and absence of access violations considering an environment with and without hardware support. The results show that this method is competitive to explicit parallelization or auto-parallelization, yet can be applied even when data dependency checks remain inconclusive at compilation time. 1},

	Abstract = {Modeling uranium transport at the Hanford 300 Area presents new challenges for high performance computing. A field-scale three-dimensional domain with an hourly fluctuating Columbia river stage coupled to flow in highly permeable sediments results in fast groundwater flow rates requiring small time steps. In this work, high-performance computing has been applied to simulate variably saturated groundwater flow and tracer transport at the 300 Area using PFLOTRAN. Simulation results are presented for discretizations up to 10.8 million degrees of freedom, while PFLOTRAN performance was assessed on up to one billion degrees of freedom and 12,000 processor cores on Jaguar, the Cray XT4 supercomputer at ORNL.},

	I present the results of a broad survey of memory bandwidth and machine
	balance for a large variety of current computers, including uniprocessors,
	vector processors, shared-memory systems, and districuted-memory

	Abstract = {We present a reduction from the problem of colouring the vertices of the graph to the maximum independent set problem (MISP) showing that for an <i>n</i>-vertex graph <i>G</i> the sum of the chromatic number of <i>G</i> and the independence number of a graph derived from the complement of <i>G</i> is equal to <i>n</i>. We investigate the applicability of the MISP greedy algorithm to the graph colouring problem. We prove that the well-known Leighton RLF algorithm and an algorithm obtained by modifying the MISP greedy heuristic behave in exactly the same way.},

We give an algorithm for colouring a graph subject to (i) and give a new easily determined bound for the number of colours needed. This same bound is also a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of the degrees of its vertices. 10.1093/comjnl/10.1.85},

	Abstract = {Illative combinatory logic consists of the theory of combinators or lambda calculus extended by extra constants (and corresponding axioms and rules) intended to capture inference. The paper considers systems of illative combinatory logic that are sound for first-order propositional and predicate calculus. The interpretation from ordinary logic into the illative systems can be done in two ways: following the propositions-as-types paradigm, in which derivations become combinators or, in a more direct way, in which derivations are not translated. Both translations are closely related in a canonical way. The two direct translations turn out to be complete. The paper fulfills the program of Church [1932], [1933] and Curry [1930] to base logic on a consistent system of {\OE}ª-terms or combinators. Hitherto this program had failed because systems of ICL were either too weak (to provide a sound interpretation) or too strong (sometimes even inconsistent).},

	Abstract = {We introduce the blame calculus, which adds the notion of blame from Findler and Felleisen's contracts to a system similar to Siek and Taha's gradual types and Flanagan's hybrid types. We characterise where positive and negative blame can arise by decomposing the usual notion of subtype into positive and negative subtyping, and show that these recombine to yield naive subtyping. Naive typing has previously appeared in type systems that are unsound, but we believe this is the first time naive subtyping has played a role in establishing type soundness. },

	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of
                  abstracting from concrete, efficient algorithms to
                  obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with
                  different data representations to produce a wide
                  variety of useful software. Four kinds of
                  abstraction-data, algorithmic, structural, and
                  representational-are discussed, with examples of
                  their use in building an Ada library of software
                  components. The main topic discussed is generic
                  algorithms and an approach to their formal
                  specification and verification, with illustration in
                  terms of a partitioning algorithm such as is used in
                  the quicksort algorithm. It is argued that
                  generically programmed software component libraries
                  offer important advantages for achieving software
                  productivity and reliability.},

@inproceedings{jazayeri98:_generic_programming,
	Abstract = {Generic programming is a sub-discipline of computer
                  science that deals with finding abstract
                  representations of efficient algorithms, data
                  structures, and other software concepts, and with
                  their systematic organization. The goal of generic
                  programming is to express algorithms and data
                  structures in a broadly adaptable, interoperable
                  form that allows their direct use in software
                  construction. Key ideas include: Expressing
                  algorithms with minimal assumptions about data
                  abstractions, and vice versa, thus making them as
                  interoperable as possible. Lifting of a concrete
                  algorithm to as general a level as possible without
                  losing efficiency; i.e., the most abstract form such
                  that when specialized back to the concrete case the
                  result is just as efficient as the original
                  algorithm. When the result of lifting is not general
                  enough to cover all uses of an algorithm,
                  additionally providing a more general form, but
                  ensuring that the most efficient specialized form is
                  automatically chosen when applicable. Providing more
                  than one generic algorithm for the same purpose and
                  at the same level of abstraction, when none
                  dominates the others in efficiency for all
                  inputs. This introduces the necessity to provide
                  sufficiently precise characterizations of the domain
                  for which each algorithm is the most efficient. },

	Abstract = {The type structure of programming languages has been
                  the subject of an active development characterized
                  by continued controversy over basic principles. In
                  this paper, we formalize a view of these principles
                  somewhat similar to that of J. H. Morris. We
                  introduce an extension of the typed lambda calculus
                  which permits user-defined types and polymorphic
                  functions, and show that the semantics of this
                  language satisfies a representation theorem which
                  embodies our notion of a `correct' type structure.},

	Abstract = {Compiler technology for multimedia extensions must effectively utilize not only the SIMD compute engines but also the various levels of the memory hierarchy: superword registers, multi-level caches and TLB. In this paper, we describe a compiler that combines optimization across all levels of the memory hierarchy with automatic generation of SIMD code for multimedia extensions. At the high-level, model-guided empirical optimization is used to transform code to optimize for all levels of the memory hierarchy. This compiler interacts with a backend compiler exploiting superword-level parallelism that takes sequential code as input and produces SIMD code. This paper discusses how we have combined these technologies into a single framework. Through a case study with matrix multiply, we observe performance results that outperform the hand-tuned Intel MKL library, and achieve performance that is within 4% of the ATLAS self-tuning library with architectural defaults and more than 4X faster than the native Intel compiler.},

@article{Kandemir:2005uq,
	Abstract = {Exploiting spatial and temporal locality is essential for obtaining high performance on modern computers. Writing programs that exhibit high locality of reference is difficult and error-prone. Compiler researchers have developed loop transformations that allow the conversion of programs to exploit locality. Recently, transformations that change the memory layouts of multi-dimensional arrays--called data transformations--have been proposed. Unfortunately, both data and loop transformations have some important drawbacks. In this work, we present an integrated framework that uses loop and data transformations in concert to exploit the benefits of both approaches while minimizing the impact of their disadvantages. Our approach works inter-procedurally on acyclic call graphs, uses profile data to eliminate layout conflicts, and is unique in its capability of resolving conflicting layout requirements of different references to the same array in the same nest and in different nests for regular array-based applications. The optimization technique presented in this paper has been implemented in a source-to-source translator. We evaluate its performance using standard benchmark suites and several math libraries (complete programs) with large input sizes. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the performance of the applications optimized by using the current state-of-the-art techniques by 8.2% on the average. This reduction comes from three important characteristics of the technique, namely, resolving layout conflicts between references to the same array in a loop nest, determining a suitable order to propagate layout modifications across loop nests, and propagating layouts between different procedures in the program--all in a unified framework. The locality optimization technique presented in this paper tries to exploit locality in the innermost loop positions. This strategy, in most cases, generates dependence-free outer loops, which can be safely parallelized.},

                 matrix-matrix multiplication that is part of the widely used GotoBLAS library. Design decisions 
                 are justified by successively refining a model of architectures with multilevel memories. 
                 A simple but effective algorithm for executing this operation results. Implementations on a 
                 broad selection of architectures are shown to achieve near-peak performance.},

	Abstract = {
MLF is a language that extends both ML and System F and combines the
benefits of both. We propose a dag representation of MLF types that
superposes a term-dag, encoding the underlying term-structure with
sharing, and a binding tree, encoding the binding-structure. This
representation is more canonical as it factors out most of the
notational details of the original definition; it is also closely
related to first-order terms. Moreover, it permits a simpler and more
direct definition of type instance that combines type-instance on
first-order term-dags, simple operations on dags, and a control that
allows or rejects potential instances. Thanks to this representation, we
obtain an incremental linear-time unification algorithm for MLF types,
which we prove sound and complete with respect to the specification.
  We also extend term graphs to express constraints on graphs that can
be rewritten incrementally, which suffices to describe all operations
needed by type inference.

	Abstract = {{
The need for direct memory manipulation through pointers is essential in
many applications. However, it is also commonly understood that the use (or
probably misuse) of pointers is often a rich source of program errors.
Therefore, approaches that can effectively enforce safe use of pointers in
programming are highly sought after.  ATS is a programming language with a
type system rooted in a recently developed framework Applied Type System,
and a novel and desirable feature in ATS lies in its support for safe
programming with pointers through a novel notion of {\em stateful
views}. In particular, even pointer arithmetic is allowed in ATS and
guaranteed to be safe by the type system of ATS.  In this paper, we give an
overview of this feature in ATS, presenting some interesting examples based
on a prototype implementation of ATS to demonstrate the practicality of
safe programming with pointer through stateful views.

The wide practice of objected oriented programming (OOP) in current
software practice is evident. Despite extensive studies on typing
programming objects, it is still undeniably a challenging research task to
design a type system that can satisfactorily account for a variety of
features (e.g., binary methods and multiple inheritance) in OOP. In this
paper, we present a typeful approach to implementing objects that makes use
of a recently introduced notion of guarded datatypes. In particular, we
demonstrate how the feature of multiple inheritance can be supported with
this approach, presenting a simple and general account for multiple
inheritance in a typeful manner.

	Abstract = {{
Gentzen's Hauptsatz -- cut elimination theorem -- in sequent calculi
reveals a fundamental property on logic connectives in various logics such
as classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  In this paper, we implement a
procedure in Haskell to perform cut elimination for intuitionistic sequent
calculus, where we use types to guarantee that the procedure can only
return a cut-free proof of the same sequent when given a proof of a sequent
that may contain cuts.  The contribution of the paper is two-fold.  On
the one hand, we present an interesting (and somewhat unexpected) application
of the current type system of Haskell, illustrating through a concrete
example how some typical use of dependent types can be simulated in
Haskell. On the other hand, we identify several problematic issues with
such a simulation technique and then suggest some approaches to addressing
these issues in Haskell.

	Abstract = {Writing performance-critical programs can be frustrating because
   optimizing compilers for imperative languages tend to be
   unpredictable. For a subset of optimizations - those that simplify
   rather than reorder code - it would be useful to prove that a compiler
   reliably performs optimizations. We show that adopting a
   ``superanalysis'' approach to optimization enables such a proof. By
   analogy with linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an optimizer
   as those programs it reduces to the empty program. To span the
   nullspace, we define rewrite rules that de-optimize programs by
   introducing abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
   sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications is undone by the
   optimizer. Thus, we are able to give programmers a clear mental model
   of what simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to perform, and
   make progress on the problem of ``abstraction penalty'' in imperative
   languages.},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

	Abstract = {Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, which results in large
                 speed increases for many applications. A simple example
                 that generates factorials at compile time is presented.
                 Although this technique might seem like just a cute C++
                 trick, it becomes powerful when combined with normal
                 C++ code. In this hybrid approach, source code contains
                 two programs: the normal C++ runtime program, and a
                 template metaprogram that runs at compile time.
                 Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively
                 inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation of an
                 algorithm that works for a specific input size, and has
                 its loops unrolled. This results in large speed
                 increases for many applications. The article presents a
                 simple template metaprogram that generates a bubble
                 sort algorithm and its performance is analysed.},

                   meta-programming, in particular program generation, and
                   its use in software development. The second part
                   introduces a basic calculus, related to FreshML, that
                   supports program generation (as described through
                   examples and a translation of MetaML into it) and
                   programming in-the-large (this is demonstrated by a
                   translation of CMS into it).},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

@article{Zhao:2005qf,
	Abstract = {Array syntax, which is supported in many technical programming languages, adds expressive power by allowing operations on and assignments to whole arrays and array sections. To compile an array assignment statement to a uniprocessor, the language processor must convert the statement into a loop that has the same meaning. This process is called scalarization.Scalarization presents a significant technical problem because an array assignment needs to be implemented as if all inputs are fetched before any outputs are stored. Since a loop intermixes loads and stores, the compiler typically allocates a temporary array to hold the intermediate result. Because these extra temporary arrays can cause performance problems in cache, many techniques have been developed to avoid their use or minimize their size.In this paper, we present a novel application of two compiler strategies--loop alignment and loop skewing--to address this problem. We show that these strategies can achieve the asymptotically minimal memory allocation for stencil computations. Our experiments with loop alignment and loop skewing demonstrate that it is extremely effective in improving memory hierarchy performance of Fortran 90 array code on standard uniprocessors. The result should be applicable to other array languages, such as MATLAB.},

	Abstract = {The framework of graph transformation combines the potentials and advantages
of both, graphs and rules, to a single computational paradigm. In this paper we
present some recent developments in applying graph transformation as a rule-based
framework for the specification and development of systems, languages, and tools.
After reviewing the basic features of graph transformation, we discuss a selection of
applications, including the evaluation of functional expressions, the specification of
an interactive graphical tool, an example specification for abstract data types, and
the definition of a visual database query language. The case studies indicate the
need for suitable structuring principles which are independent of a particular graph
transformation approach. To this end, we present the concept of a transformation
unit, which allows systematic and structured specification and programming based
on graph transformation.},

	Abstract = {If the set of atomic formulas is augmented by adding a `universal
formula' and a `null formula', then the equivalence classes of this set under
alphabetic variation form a complete non-modular lattice, with `instance'
as the partial ordering, `greatest common instance' as the meet operation,
and `least common generalization' as the join operation. The greatest common
instance of two formulas can be obtained from Robinson's Unification Algorithm.
An algorithm is given for computing the least common generalization of two
formulas, the covering relation of the lattice is determined, bounds are
obtained on the length of chains from one formula to another, and it is shown
that any formula is the least common  generalization of its set of ground
instances.
A transformational system is a finite set of clauses containing only units
and transformations, which are clauses containing exactly one positive and one
negative literal. It is shown that every unsatisfiable transformational system
has a refutation where every resolution has at least one resolvend which is an
initial clause. An algorithm is given for computing a common generalization of
all atomic formulas which can be derived from a transformational system, and
it is shown that there is no decision procedure for transformational systems.},

	Abstract = {We explore the thesis that type structure is a syntactic discipline
for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been
formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass
higher-order functions.  For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize
homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an `abstraction' theorem
that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions,
including user-defined types. Finally, we consider polymorphic functions,
and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of
parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.},

@techreport{Cheney:2003fq,
	Abstract = {Classical phantom types are datatypes in which type constraints are expressed using type variables that do not appear in the datatype cases themselves. They can be used to embed typed languages into Haskell or ML. However, while such encodings guarantee that only well-formed data can be constructed, they do not permit type-safe deconstruction without additional tagging and run-time checks. We introduce first-class phantom types, which make such constraints explicit via type equations. Examples of first-class phantom types include typed type representations and typed higher-order abstract syntax trees. These types can be used to support typed generic functions, dynamic typing, and staged compilation in higher-order, statically typed languages such as Haskell or Standard ML. In our system, type constraints can be equations between type constructors as well as type functions of higher-order kinds. We prove type soundness and decidability for a Haskell-like language extended by first-class phantom types.},

@inproceedings{Liang:1995ia,
	Abstract = {We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct
programming language interpreters, and present implementations
of such building blocks capable of supporting many
commonly known features, including simple expressions,
three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, callby-
value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment,
nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing.
The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers,
a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide
range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations,
and exceptions.
Our work is significant in the following respects. First,
we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter
based on monad transformers that includes features missing
from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts.
Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations
through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not
achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated
that interactions between features are reflected in
liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering
monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our
interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just
the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise
and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation
includes a method for constructing extensible unions
and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.},

	Address = {New York, {NY}, {USA}},
	Annote = {Generic programming has recently emerged as a paradigm
for developing highly-reusable software libraries, most notably in C++.
We have designed and implemented a constrained generics
extension for C++ to support modular type-checking of generic
algorithms and to address other issues associated with unconstrained
generics.
To be as broadly applicable as possible, generic algorithms are
defined with minimal requirements on their inputs.
At the same time, to not lose potential efficiency, generic algorithms
may have multiple implementations that exploit features of specific
classes of inputs.
This process of algorithm specialization relies on non-local type
information and conflicts directly with the local nature of modular
type-checking.
In this paper, we review the design and implementation of our
extensions for generic programming in C++, describe the issues of
algorithm specialization and modular type-checking in detail, and
discuss the important design tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both.
We present the particular design that we chose for our implementation,
with the goal of hitting the sweet spot in this interesting design space.},

	Abstract = {This paper specifies, via a Hoare-like logic, an interprocedural and flow sensitive (but termination insensitive) information flow analysis for object-oriented programs. Pointer aliasing is ubiquitous in such programs, and can potentially leak confidential information. Thus the logic employs independence assertions to describe the noninterference property that formalizes confidentiality, and employs region assertions to describe possible aliasing. Programmer assertions, in the style of JML, are also allowed, thereby permitting a more fine-grained specification of information flow policy.The logic supports local reasoning about state in the style of separation logic. Small specifications are used; they mention only the variables and addresses relevant to a command. Specifications are combined using a frame rule. An algorithm for the computation of postconditions is described: under certain assumptions, there exists a strongest postcondition which the algorithm computes.

	Abstract = {Embedded code pointers (ECPs) are stored handles of functions and continuations commonly seen in low-level binaries as well as functional or higher-order programs. ECPs are known to be very hard to support well in Hoare-logic style verification systems. As a result, existing proof-carrying code (PCC) systems have to either sacrifice the expressiveness or the modularity of program specifications, or resort to construction of complex semantic models. In Reynolds's LICS'02 paper, supporting ECPs is listed as one of the main open problems for separation logic.In this paper we present a simple and general technique for solving the ECP problem for Hoare-logic-based PCC systems. By adding a small amount of syntax to the assertion language, we show how to combine semantic consequence relation with syntactic proof techniques. The result is a new powerful framework that can perform modular reasoning on ECPs while still retaining the expressiveness of Hoare logic. We show how to use our techniques to support polymorphism, closures, and other language extensions and how to solve the ECP problem for separation logic. Our system is fully mechanized. We give its complete soundness proof and a full verification of Reynolds's CPS-style "list-append" example in the Coq proof assistant.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining imperative and
  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.},

@techreport{friedman03:_improve_krivine_tr,
	Annote = {Krivine presents the K machine, which produces weak head normal form results. Sestoft introduces several call-by-need variants of the K machine that implement result sharing via pushing update markers on the stack in a way similar to the TIM and the STG machine. When a sequence of consecutive markers appears on the stack, all but the first cause redundant updates. Improvements related to these sequences have dealt with either the consumption of the markers or the removal of the markers once they appear. Here we present an improvement that eliminates the production of marker sequences of length greater than one. This improvement results in the C machine, a more space and time efficient variant of K. We then apply the classic optimization of short-circuiting operand variable dereferences to create the call-by-need S machine. Finally, we combine the two improvements in the CS machine. On our benchmarks this machine uses half the stack space, performs one quarter as many updates, and executes between 27 0.000000aster and 17lower than our L variant of Sestoft's lazy Krivine machine. More interesting is that on one benchmark L, S, and C consume unbounded space, but CS consumes constant space. Our comparisons to Sestoft's Mark 2 machine are not exact, however, since we restrict ourselves to unpreprocessed closed lambda terms. Our variant of his machine does no environment trimming, conversion to deBruijn-style variable access, and does not provide basic constants, data type constructors, or the recursive let. (The Y combinator is used instead.)},

	Annote = {The past decade of experience has demonstrated that the generic programming methodology is highly effective for the design, implementation, and use of large-scale software libraries. The fundamental principle of generic programming is the realization of interfaces for entire sets of components, based on their essential syntactic and semantic requirements, rather than for any particular components. Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces between software components, but none completely support the approach used in generic programming. We have recently developed G, a language designed to provide first-class language support for generic programming and large-scale libraries. In this paper, we present an overview of G and analyze the interdependence between language features and libraries design in light of a complete implementation of the Standard Template Library using G. In addition, we discuss important issues related to modularity and encapsulation in large-scale libraries and how language support for validation of components in isolation can prevent many common problems in component integration. },

	Annote = {``Concepts'' are an essential language feature needed to support generic programming in the large. Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we present the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. Concepts include a novel combination of associated types and same-type constraints that do not appear in type classes, but that are similar to nested types and type sharing in ML.},

	Abstract = {The Microsoft .NET Framework is a new computing architecture designed to support a variety of distributed applications and web-based services. .NET software components are typically distributed in an object-oriented intermediate language, Microsoft IL, executed by the Microsoft Common Language Runtime. To allow convenient multi-language working, IL supports a wide variety of high-level language constructs, including class-based objects, inheritance, garbage collection, and a security mechanism based on type safe execution.This paper precisely describes the type system for a substantial fragment of IL that includes several novel features: certain objects may be allocated either on the heap or on the stack; those on the stack may be boxed onto the heap, and those on the heap may be unboxed onto the stack; methods may receive arguments and return results via typed pointers, which can reference both the stack and the heap, including the interiors of objects on the heap. We present a formal semantics for the fragment. Our typing rules determine well-typed IL instruction sequences that can be assembled and executed. Of particular interest are rules to ensure no pointer into the stack outlives its target. Our main theorem asserts type safety, that well-typed programs in our IL fragment do not lead to untrapped execution errors.Our main theorem does not directly apply to the product. Still, the formal system of this paper is an abstraction of informal and executable specifications we wrote for the full product during its development. Our informal specification became the basis of the product team's working specification of type-checking. The process of writing this specification, deploying the executable specification as a test oracle, and applying theorem proving techniques, helped us identify several security critical bugs during development.},

	Abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being used in vision, robotics and other control systems applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation. As an example of a limitation, we show that streams are incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events over behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of abstracting from concrete? ef 
 cient algorithms to obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with di erent
data representations to produce a wide variety of useful software  For example? a
class of generic sorting algorithms can be de ned which work with  nite sequences
but which can be instantiated in di erent ways to produce algorithms working on
arrays or linked lists 
Four kinds of abstraction -- data, algorithmic, structural, and representational --
are discussed, with examples of their use in building an Ada library of software
components  The main topic discussed is generic algorithms and an approach to
their formal speci cation and verification, with illustration in terms of a partitioning
algorithm such as is used in the quicksort algorithm  It is argued that generically
programmed software component libraries o er important advantages for achieving
software productivity and reliability },

@article{G.-D.-Plotkin:1975on,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the ?-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new ?-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual ?-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

	Optannote = {Probably the closest to what we're doing. System is built of modules. Modules are connected through either method calls and ports. Meanings of method calls and ports are by convention among classes of modules to allow module replacement. To make this easier to manage, modules have a "module type" which defines which interface convention (calls and ports) it implements. Modules can also say that they must have some sub-module of a given module type (i.e. a branch predictor must have a branch predictor algorithm sub-module). Feeder modules provide the instructions to execute; can be set up to feed from traces or emulation. Ports model communication delays. MoC isn't clearly specified: each module has a clock method, but how to deal with zero-cycle scheduling isn't clear. Ports are stated to be "good" relative to method calls because they do not have side effects. Strange mechanism for connecting sub-modules to sub-modules without the parent modules knowing what's happening. My guess is that it is similar to the query mechanism. Written in C++; writing new modules means writing new C++ classes. Nice working environment.},

The set of admissible operations is determined in each time step from precedence rules and resource constraints. Does not use a rule-based approach (whatever that is) because it is easier to change the instruction set. A Gantt chart is provided for each instruction (thus no dynamic data routing). The Gantt chart gives resource vs. time like a reservation station, but fills in the spot with the operation using the resource at that time. Earliest instruction in program order always wins arbitration for resources. *Cannot do out of order* Data hazards are handled by extending the Gantt chart to know whether reads or writes of storage resources are occurring.

	Optannote = {UPFAST - Not a bad idea: there is some attempt to map behavior of instructions to behavior of hardware. However, it is completely unmodular: the description is flat and removing one thing can easily modify others. The user must also figure out how to schedule simulator ops (through minor cycles) if anything other than simple pipe control (extended with stalls, freezes, and reserving of units) is desired. No default behavior of any kind is provided; with a new machine, you start from scratch. Instruction context is rather like dynids, but in the spirit of flatness, you cannot extend it in a scattered fashion: it has to be done in one statement. Regular operations (artifacts) are rather like channels or buildpipe stages. Switching one of these out for a custom one is difficult. ISA must always say how sub-ops map to the uarch. Because all operations must be specified, adding stats is done by changing the semantics of particular stages/instructions, though they can be automagically printed at the end. Note that instructions must follow a regular pipeline structure. How an instruction context is allocated is unclear. Cancelling is done through a retire statement (I think), so you have to be careful about statistics to look at retired instructions retiring in the commit stage. Exceptions are probably doable, and multiple pipelines might manage to do MP (but the absence of modularity and hierarchy would make it hard). Built using templates with inserted code at markers.

The signal would be asserted when a RAW hazard exists. Signals can be built from boolean expressions of each other. Latches between stages are implied, but their datatypes can be defined. Multiple PC's can be supported by defining pipeline strategies to start instructions in the pipeline (pretty neat idea that!) Hierarchy is posible, as are multiple pipelines talking to each other. Unclear about what the MoC is for these parallel pipelines. In general, good ideas about common flow control issues. Still has an instruction-centric view of what work is to be done in the processor instead of the processor-centric view common to OOO. Could make it difficult to arbitrate between instructions. Extensibility is through reprogramming; definitely not modular. It might be interesting to let buildpipe read RADL to generate simple pipelines.},

No modularity or extensibility features provided. Interesting: hand-coded skipping had incredible benefits. Facile simulator is seriously slower than SS without memoization, and at most 3x faster with. It is even worse for one. This is probably because the Facile code is so bad. It is unclear whether the caches and branch predictor take into account speculative side-effects. Our time skipping may provide some of the benefits, at least during stalls. A monolithic pipeline model might be able to use partial eval to speed itself up (that might be worth pursuing...)

Should be similar, but may have problems going between ISAs. They handle speculative execution by saving state at branches. That's fine, but cannot support direct execution of anything other than control speculation. Would be very much like writing the simulator to work with level 3 emulation. However, branch instructions call into the simulator to get branch predictions, so there's a convoluted mixing of control that might make polypath type things really ugly. No data moved around simulator, just like ours (when we're not modeling power) cache simulator doesn't schedule an event return: it tells the core simulator how long before it should be called again for that instruction and the core calls it again. This allows the cache simulator messages to not be parameters or globals to the core loop. Also, the core has a tiny amount of state to keep track of pipeline state (16 bytes + 2 bytes per instruction). This allows the core to memoize based upon this small quantity of state. The pipeline in the core is limited to ones where an instruction occupies one stage. The state also looks at how far the instruction is from moving on. The cache "retry" mechanism is intriguing; the cache is responsible for seeing that the return bandwidth is correct and the core just has to go and get it at the right time. The core recomputes the dependency information each cycle (re-renaming each time) so that it doesn't keep dependency information as state. The PC is added to the state and the whole thing is compressed to give the "signature" for memoization. Memoization caches need pruned every now and then!

	Optannote = {Compiled simulation with LISA Look at the compiled simulation paper for the idea of what they are trying to do. Then imagine doing this in LISA instead of C. This paper shows zero, get it zero, details of how they managed to code any of the interesting stuff (the pipeline) in LISA. Interesting data point: designing a TMS320C6201 DSP model took 6 weeks for one designer. How many days for me? I'm tempted.... But only 35 seconds to compile on a Ultra 10.... simulation speed was 307Kinst/sec for ADPCM. Biggest problem would be RT_x (and getting a compiler :-), though I could try an interpreter. Something to do after GLAD is done. I think what ends up happening is that you write a LISA description which incorporates all this knowledge: things like a function to call if instruction in EX is this and instruction in ID is that and instruction in IF is those. Then the compiled code calls the magic "one function" that matches the machine state. Good heavens! No wonder it took the designer forever! Or maybe you write the functions and then check at run time and the run time check was nasty. That would be a basic "bad code partitioning" problem. Or maybe the designer wasn't too hot: the paper states he spent 12 months on a custom simulator for a simpler processor.... Philosophical question: is it better to spend 6 weeks making a model which does 300K instr/sec or 6 hours writing one that does 30K instr/sec? Think about this explicitly in the DSP domain...},

	Optannote = {A bit better description of "compiled simulation" which is the "pre-figure" what the state of the machine would be at each point in time. Branching is handled by providing alternative new states, so running through the simulator is essentially figuring out what the branch directions are to know which alternative states apply. Indirect branches mess things up and require going to a normal "dynamic scheduling" mode for a while. Note that either mode is similar to level 1 or 4 emulation with calls to the simulator state update functions inside each function. Dynamic mode would be the same with a call to "figure out cycle" (our original emulation idea). This figure out cycle stuff is table-driven, so it assumes a fair amount of knowledge of the machine. Speculative execution might be possible. I guess you could deal with "pick the wrong alternative and roll it back" kind of stuff, knowing which instruction would resolve the previous branch.... but how would you deal with out-of-order? I guess you would know the dependencies at compile time as well, so you would have each instruction check move the state of the instructions it has affected. Also, anything variable latency (such as cache misses) would change the relative timing and the state update function which must be applied. SuperSim is the result of all this. Build process is *very* similar to Liberty: target object/assembly -> C -> host object. Neat technique for a (very) limited class of machines. And none of this works in a modular fashion or is retargetable.},
